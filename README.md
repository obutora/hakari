## Features

- Measure code execution time in micro/milliseconds
- Intuitive bar chart display of results
- Comparing multiple benchmark results

## Getting started

```
flutter pub add hakari
```

## Usage

```dart

final list = List.generate(100000, (index) => index);

final group = Group(
  name: 'Exploring fast loops in Dart.',
  benches: [
    Bench('loop', () async {
      var count = 0;
      num eachElement = 0;
      while (count < list.length) {
        eachElement = pow(list[count], 3);
        count++;
      }
    }),
    Bench('for in', () async {
      num eachElement = 0;
      for (var element in list) {
        eachElement = pow(element, 3);
      }
    }),
    Bench('forEach', () async {
      num eachElement = 0;
      list.forEach((e) {
        eachElement = pow(e, 3);
      });
    }),
    Bench('map', () async {
      num eachElement = 0;
      list.map((e) {
        eachElement = pow(e, 3);
      }).toList();
    }),
  ],

final hakari = Hakari(
    groups: [
      group,
    ],
    option: HakariOption(
      maxLineCharNum: 80,
      iter: 100,
      // emphasisAnsiColor: some value [0-255],
      // barAnsiColor: some value [0-255],
    
await hakari.start();
```

Happy Benchmarking! ðŸš€
